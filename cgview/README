Currently, this directory just contains _example_ code for using
KCachegrind's libcore for command line tools. It is not expected
to be packaged with KCachegrind (therefore, nothing is installed).

Eventually, it will grow into a convertion/merge/filter tool for
profile data, and a replacement for the callgrind_annotate
script from the Valgrind package (which is broken as it does not
handle profile data with instruction granularity, as well as
cycle detection).
