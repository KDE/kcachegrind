OVERVIEW

This directory contains widgets which display views
into profile data. A view either shows some aspect of
the profile data directly, are is a container for
other views.

All views are subclasses of TraceItemView.

Implementation of all views depend on Qt only.
KDE-specific views, these should be in kcachegrind/.


VIEWS


Container views
---------------

TabView

A Tabview embeds multiple views with the same cost item
selected/activated. The views can be arranged either
on top of each other using tabs for selection, or nearside
each other in four regions (right/top/left/bottom).

Multiview

A Multiview is a horizontal or vertical series of embedded views,
separated by splitters.
Eeach embedded view can have its own cost item selection/activation.
One of the views has the focus, and thus providing the
selection/activation of the multiview itself.
Selection in one view changes the activation in the next view to
the right/bottom (with wrap around).


Detailed views
--------------

EventTypeView

A list of event types measured in the profile experiment,
attributed with the costs of the currently activated cost item.

CallView

A list of callers/callees of the currently activated cost item.

CallMapView

A treemap showing the nesting of callers/callees starting from
the currently activated cost item.

CallGraphView

A graph around the currently activated cost item, with edges
being the call relations. Only nodes and edges with cost over a
given threshould are shown.

CoverageView

Similar to the CallView list, the coverage list includes not
only direct callers/callees, but also indirect.

SourceView

Annotated source.

InstrView

Annotated assembly.

PartView

List of loaded profile data parts
