KCachegrind
===========

Background

Profiling, i.e. running an application under observation of a measurement
tool to try to determe the most time consuming parts, is in important
step for performance analysis and optimizations.
KCachegrind visualizes profile data files, which are generated as
measurement output from profiling.


Features

* direct support for profiles generated by Cachegrind/Callgrind
  (various conversion scripts for data from other profilers provided)
* support for arbitrary event types and derived event types
* sorted function list, with grouping according to ELF object/source
  file/symbol namespace (such as C++ classes)
* correct handling of recursive cycles (similar to GProf)
* various visualization views for a selected function, such as
  - treemap in caller/callee direction
  - call graph around function
  - source & assembly annotation


Compilation and Installation

Requirements:
* KDE4.x: kdelibs development packages (libs & headers)
* CMake

Commands (from base dir of KCachegrind):
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make install


Help

KCachegrind has detailed "What's this?" help for
each GUI part. For further help, see quick starter pages
