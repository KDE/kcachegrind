This directory just contains _example_ code for using KCachegrind's
libcore/libviews in Qt-only apps, such as IDEs.

As it is useless to provide a stripped-down Qt-only application
within a KDE package together with the full-blown KDE version,
it is not installed.

For demonstration purpose, qcachegrind can be build without KDE libs
at all, using just qmake with the example qcachegrind.pro file.
For this, run "qmake; make".
