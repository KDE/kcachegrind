This directory contains some scripts to convert output of different
profiling tools into the format which can be loaded by KCachegrind.
See the comment at start of every script for details.

In the long run, these should be replaced by import filters in
KCachegrind directly, but I can't promise anything. Partly, this
is because some scripts are provided as contribution from others.

hotshot2cg	Converter for the Python Hotshot Profiler.
op2cg           Converter for OProfile sampling data.
