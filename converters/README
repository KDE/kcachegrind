This directory contains some scripts to convert output of different
profiling tools into the format which can be loaded by KCachegrind.
See the comment at start of every script for details.

In the long run, these should be replaced by import filters in
KCachegrind directly, but I can't promise anything. Partly, this
is because some scripts are provided as contribution from others.

hotshot2calltree   Converter from Python Hotshot Profiler.
op2calltree        Converter from OProfile sampling data. 
dprof2calltree     Converter from PERL::DProf Profiler.
pprof2calltree     Converter from APD PHP Profiler.

Thanks go to
* George Schlossnagle <george@omniti.com> for
  dprof2calltree and pprof2calltree,
* Jörg Beyer <job@webde-ag.de> for
  hotshot2calltree

If you want to write a converter, have a look at the calltree format
description on the web site (kcachegrind.sf.net).
